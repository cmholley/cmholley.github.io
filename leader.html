									<h3 class="major">Honors Mentor</h3>

									<p>For the past two years I have been selected as an Honors Mentor at the University of Houston. The Honors Mentoring programm matches incoming Honors freshman with an upperclass men who serves as that freshman's Honors Mentor. Our job as mentors is to help ease the transition from high school to college life. We provide a source of information, plan events to help the students get involved, and spend time with our group of mentees during the course of their first 10 weeks. My mentor was one of the most impactful people I met during my first semester at college, and I wanted to be that for someone else. </p>

									<h3 class="major">DASH</h3>
									<p><strong>Data Analytics in Student Hands</strong> is an organization on campus that seeks to combine cutting edge technology, education and data to better understand the world around us. As an employee of this organization, I worked with community partners such as the UNT Health Science Center, the Blaffer Art Museum, and Texas Community Health workers to develop data driven web applications. As a interdisciplinary organization, I have been able to work under an engineer and a philosopher simultaneously. This diversity has been a key part of my development into a strong, purposeful, thoughtful individual and programmer. As the lead server side developer, I was directly involved in every part of our projects, not just the coding. I designed database schemas, maintained the Linux servers that run our applications, spoke with clients, and developed management procedures such as our git workflow. Take a look at two of my projects below, or visit the <a href="www.housuggest.org/DASH"> DASH website</a> to learn more about the organization.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Houston Scholars</h3>

									<p>I have been selected as a 2015-2016 Houston Scholar. Through this program, I have developed, written and defended an independent research proposal for funding. After this process, I was able to secure funding to travel to <emphasized>RWTH Achen</emphasized> to do research focuing on the visualization of IO data in parallel processing. I will be conducting my research during the Summer of 2016, so check back for more updates!</p>
