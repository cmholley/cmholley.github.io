									<h2 class="major">Why Study?</h2>
									<h4>Computer Science</h3>
									 <p>When I was a kid, I played a lot of video games. I still remember the first time I accidently hit the '~' key while playing Counter Strike and opened the developer console. I had no clue what it was, or how to use it, but I was fascinated by the numbers, strange words and lines of text running across my screen. Soon, I learned how to use the console to change the game, bending it exactly how I want it. From that point on, I was not only obsessed with computers and technology, but controlling them. This is what drove me to learn how to code in high school. When it came time to pick a major for college, Computer Science just made sense.</p>

									<h4>Mathematics</h4> 
									<p>In 6th grade one of my teachers talked me into going to a Math Club meeting. I thought it was ridiclous, but I went. That day they were taking a Rocket City Math League test. Sponsored by Mu Alpha Theta, the test asked real math questions, not just calculations. It wasn't about memorizing formulas, it was about critical thinking, creativity, and rigourous attention. I continued to compete in math competitions through the school. When I started college and picked Computer Science as my major, I knew I wanted more math. So I took an theoritcal math course. I loved it, and knew I wanted more.</p>

									<h4>Leadership</h4>
									<p>I've always been a natural leader. Extroverted, friendly, loud, passionate. I've always wanted to be the guy in front. During my Freshman year, my mentor encouraged me to try think about a Leadership Studies minor. I took the first class and realized how little I actually really know about being a leader. I learned that leadership is as much about service and respect than power. The coursework in the Leadership Studies minor prepares me for leadership in whatever form it may come. Whether that's managing a new project at work, or helping freshman as an Honors mentor, I feel prepared to lead and be successful.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Important Coursework</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>COSC 3320 - Algorithms and Data Structures: The information I have learned in this course, and it's pre-requisite, have been the more helpful than any other class. Understanding the fundamental and mathematical concepts behind the data structures we use has made me a better programmer. Not only did I learn information about these algorithms and data structures, writing my own algorithms and programming assignments helped me learn how to approach problem solving in a rigourous and systematic way.</li>
										<li>MATH 3325 - Transition to Advanced Mathematics: This course was not required for my degree, but I took it because of my interest in advanced mathematics. More than any other math course I have taken, this class challenged and forced me to think in new ways. By writing proofs using first order logic and the fundamental axioms of set theory, I learned the power of abstractions and modeling. This understanding of how to think axiomatically and mathematically has benefited my study of all other branches of math, as well as my coding and project management.</li>
										<li>HON 3330 - Leadership Theory and Practice: Through a series of self-assessments, reflection papers and discussions this course helped me to understand myself and my leadership. The course examined several different Leadership Theories that have been developed over the past century. This course provided insight into how I lead and how I can improve as a leader.</li> 
										<li>HON 4198 Data Analytics and Healthcare: This one hour course gave me an introduction of how stastics, machine learning, and big data analytics are used to understand health data. It was the first course that exposed me to direct applications of what I was studying, not just the theory behind it.</li>
